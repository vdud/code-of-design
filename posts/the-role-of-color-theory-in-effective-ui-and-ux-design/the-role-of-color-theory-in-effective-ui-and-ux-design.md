## Basics of color theory

> Basic fundamental concepts, such as the color wheel, primary, secondary, and tertiary colors, hue, saturation, and brightness.

The basics of color theory provide a foundation for understanding how colors work, interact, and influence one another. These fundamental concepts are essential for designers to make informed decisions when selecting and combining colors in their UI and UX designs. Here are some essential aspects of color theory:

1. **Color Wheel:** The color wheel is a circular diagram that represents the relationships between colors. It serves as a visual tool for understanding how colors interact and can be combined harmoniously. The color wheel typically consists of primary, secondary, and tertiary colors.

2. **Primary Colors:** Primary colors are the building blocks of all other colors and cannot be created by mixing other colors. In the additive color model (RGB) used in digital design, the primary colors are red, green, and blue. In the subtractive color model (CMYK) used in print design, the primary colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow.

3. **Secondary Colors:** Secondary colors are created by mixing equal parts of two primary colors. In the RGB color model, these are cyan (green + blue), magenta (red + blue), and yellow (red + green). In the CMYK model, secondary colors are red, green, and blue.

4. **Tertiary Colors:** Tertiary colors are created by mixing equal parts of a primary color and its neighboring secondary color on the color wheel. Examples include orange (red + yellow), chartreuse (green + yellow), and violet (blue + magenta).

5. **Hue:** Hue is the pure color without any added white, black, or gray. It refers to the specific color in its most saturated form (e.g., red, blue, or green).

6. **Saturation:** Saturation refers to the intensity or purity of a color. A fully saturated color contains no shades of gray, while a desaturated color appears more muted or washed out.

7. **Brightness (Value):** Brightness, or value, represents the lightness or darkness of a color. By adding white or black to a hue, you can create different shades (darker) or tints (lighter) of that color.

8. **Color Models:** Digital design primarily uses the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color model, which is an additive color model where colors are created by combining different amounts of red, green, and blue light. Print design uses the CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key/Black) color model, which is a subtractive color model where colors are created by combining varying amounts of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink.

Understanding these basics of color theory enables designers to make informed decisions when selecting and combining colors in their projects. By applying these principles, designers can create visually appealing and harmonious color schemes that enhance the overall aesthetics and user experience of their designs.

## Color harmony

> Color harmony principles, such as complementary, analogous, triadic, and split-complementary schemes, and their impact on design aesthetics.

Color harmony refers to the aesthetically pleasing and visually balanced combinations of colors in a design. By understanding and applying color harmony principles, designers can create color schemes that evoke specific emotions, guide users through interfaces, and enhance the overall visual appeal of their projects. The following are some common color harmony principles used in UI and UX design:

### **Complementary Colors**

Complementary colors are colors that sit directly opposite each other on the color wheel. When used together, these colors create a strong contrast and can make elements stand out. Examples include blue and orange, red and green, or yellow and purple. To avoid visual strain, it's important to use complementary colors judiciously, often by using one color as the dominant hue and the other for accents.
