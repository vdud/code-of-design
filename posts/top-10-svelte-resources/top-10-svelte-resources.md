| Configuration  | Uses Rollup for bundling and configuration | Uses Vite for bundling and configuration |

Both Sapper and SvelteKit are full-stack web frameworks built around Svelte. They both have built-in SSR, API, and routing capabilities, and both support code splitting and static export.

However, there are some differences between them. Sapper uses Express as its server, while SvelteKit uses Fastify. Sapper also has a slightly smaller community than SvelteKit, and may have fewer plugins available.

Overall, both frameworks are easy to learn and have good performance, so the choice between them will largely depend on personal preference and the specific needs of the project.

I personally recommend SvelteKit because it has more room for growth and is more actively maintained than Sapper.
