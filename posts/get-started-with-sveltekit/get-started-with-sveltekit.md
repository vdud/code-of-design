title: Get Started with SvelteKit
description: Svelte is an innovative, compiler-based framework designed for building highly performant and interactive user interfaces. Created by Rich Harris, a graphics editor at the New York Times, Svelte has quickly gained traction among developers for its unique approach to web application development. Unlike traditional frameworks like React and Vue, which rely on a runtime library to manage and update the DOM, Svelte operates at compile time, generating highly optimized JavaScript code that updates the DOM directly.
